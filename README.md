# Fake News Detection Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a baseline model for detecting fake news by analyzing textual data for the presence of keywords indicative of misinformation. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, the project identifies and leverages common words and phrases found in fake news articles to classify content as either fake or genuine.

Fake news detection datasets can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets).
