# Fake News Detection Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a baseline model for detecting fake news by analyzing textual data for the presence of keywords indicative of misinformation. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, the project identifies and leverages common words and phrases found in fake news articles to classify content as either fake or genuine.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `clean_data.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the data.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
5. Explore the `csc420_project_proposal_new.pdf` for detailed project proposal and methodology.
6. The notebooks contain code cells that can be executed to train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
